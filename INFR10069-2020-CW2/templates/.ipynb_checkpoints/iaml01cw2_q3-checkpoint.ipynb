    "#  - You should not change the filename of this file, 'iaml01cw2_q3.py', which is the file name you should use when you submit your code for this question.\n",
    "#  - You should define the functions shown below in your code.\n",
    "#  - You can define function arguments (parameters) and returns (attributes) if necessary.\n",
    "#  - In case you define helper functions, do not define them here, but put them in a separate Python module file, \"iaml01cw2_my_helpers.py\", and import it in this script.\n",
    "#  - For those questions requiring you to show results in tables, your code does not need to present them in tables - just showing them with print() is fine.\n",
