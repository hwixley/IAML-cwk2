#  Python script template for Question 3 (IAML Level 10)
#  Note that:
#  - You should not change the filename of this file, 'iaml01cw2_q3.py', which is the file name you should use when you submit your code for this question.
#  - You should define the functions shown below in your code.
#  - You can define function arguments (parameters) and returns (attributes) if necessary.
#  - In case you define helper functions, do not define them here, but put them in a separate Python module file, "iaml01cw2_my_helpers.py", and import it in this script.
#  - For those questions requiring you to show results in tables, your code does not need to present them in tables - just showing them with print() is fine.
#  - You do not need to include this header in your submission
